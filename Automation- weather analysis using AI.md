# Week 1: Setting Up API Integration
**Tasks:**

**API Key Setup:** Register for an API key on the OpenWeatherMap website.
**Install Requests Library:** Use pip to install the Requests library (pip install requests).
**Implement API Functionality:** Write a function to fetch weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

In the first week, I focused on setting up the API integration to retrieve weather data. After registering for an API key on the OpenWeatherMap website, I installed the Requests library using pip. With the library in place, I implemented functionality to fetch weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. This involved defining a function get_weather that constructed the API URL with the provided API key and city, made a request to the API, and returned the JSON response containing the weather data. I tested this functionality in a main block to ensure it worked correctly.
```
import requests

def get_weather(api_key, city):
    url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={api_key}&units=metric"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    return data

if __name__ == "__main__":
    api_key = "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
    city = "YOUR_CITY_NAME"
    
    weather_data = get_weather(api_key, city)
    print("Weather data:", weather_data)
```
# Week 2: Weather Analysis and Basic Suggestions
**Tasks:**

**Extract Weather Parameters:** Extract relevant weather parameters such as temperature and weather description.
**Implement Basic Suggestions:** Write logic to suggest actions based on weather conditions.

During the second week, I analyzed the fetched weather data and provided basic suggestions based on the weather conditions. I extracted relevant parameters such as temperature and weather description from the fetched data. Then, I implemented basic suggestion logic in a function suggest_actions, which considered different weather conditions such as rain, snow, high temperature, and low temperature, and provided corresponding suggestions for agricultural activities. This included suggestions like delaying outdoor activities during rain, ensuring protection for crops and livestock during extreme temperatures, and more. I integrated this suggestion logic with the weather fetching functionality from the previous week.
```
def suggest_actions(weather_data):
    temperature = weather_data['main']['temp']
    weather_description = weather_data['weather'][0]['description']

    if 'rain' in weather_description:
        return "It's raining. Consider delaying outdoor activities or implementing drainage solutions."
    elif 'snow' in weather_description:
        return "It's snowing. Ensure proper protection for crops and livestock."
    elif temperature > 30:
        return "High temperature detected. Increase watering frequency for crops and provide shade for livestock."
    elif temperature < 5:
        return "Low temperature detected. Protect crops from frost and ensure proper heating for livestock."
    else:
        return "Weather conditions are favorable. No specific actions needed."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    api_key = "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"
    city = "YOUR_CITY_NAME"
    
    weather_data = get_weather(api_key, city)
    suggested_actions = suggest_actions(weather_data)
    print("Suggested actions:", suggested_actions)
```
# Week 3: Refinement and Testing
**Tasks:**

**Code Refinement:** Review and refactor code for clarity and efficiency.
**Error Handling:** Implement error handling to manage cases where the API request fails or returns unexpected data.
**Testing:** Test the script with different cities and weather conditions to ensure it provides accurate suggestions.

In the third week of development, I focused on refining and testing the weather analysis script to ensure its reliability and robustness. The main objective was to enhance the code quality, improve error handling, and conduct thorough testing across various scenarios. This involved reviewing the code for clarity and efficiency, refactoring where necessary, and implementing comprehensive error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage cases where the API request fails or returns unexpected data. Additionally, extensive testing was performed to validate the functionality of the script under different weather conditions and for various cities.For testing the code i used Pycharm IDE. By dedicating this week to refinement and testing, I aimed to ensure that the weather analysis script meets high standards of performance, accuracy, and usability, laying a solid foundation for its deployment and future maintenance.

**City used for test:** Pfarrkirchen, DE

**Weather data results for specific city includes:** 
{'coord': {'lon': 12.9381, 'lat': 48.432}, 'weather': [{'id': 801, 'main': 'Clouds', 'description': 'few clouds', 'icon': '02n'}], 'base': 'stations', 'main': {'temp': 4.46, 'feels_like': 0.94, 'temp_min': 3.05, 'temp_max': 6.71, 'pressure': 1017, 'humidity': 83, 'sea_level': 1017, 'grnd_level': 970}, 'visibility': 10000, 'wind': {'speed': 4.45, 'deg': 257, 'gust': 13.37}, 'clouds': {'all': 21}, 'dt': 1707257540, 'sys': {'type': 2, 'id': 2091626, 'country': 'DE', 'sunrise': 1707201074, 'sunset': 1707236000}, 'timezone': 3600, 'id': 2854179, 'name': 'Pfarrkirchen', 'cod': 200}
Suggested actions: Low temperature detected. Protect crops from frost and ensure proper heating for livestock.

 **TEST SUCCESSFULL**

# Week 4: Final script with comments
In the fourth week of development, I dedicated my efforts to enhancing the maintainability and readability of the weather analysis script by adding comprehensive comments throughout the codebase. These comments serve as inline documentation, providing insights into the purpose and functionality of each component, function, and significant code block. By meticulously annotating the code, I aimed to facilitate easier understanding for myself and any future contributors who may work on the project. Each comment was carefully crafted to provide clarity and context, explaining the logic, algorithms, and data structures utilized within the script. Furthermore, I ensured consistency in the style and format of the comments, adhering to industry best practices and conventions. By completing this task, I improved the overall quality of the codebase, making it more accessible and maintainable for solo development and potential collaboration in the future.
```
import requests

    # Function to fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
def get_weather(api_key, city):
    url = f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={api_key}&units=metric"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    return data

    # Function to suggest actions based on weather conditions
def suggest_actions(weather_data):
    temperature = weather_data['main']['temp']
    weather_description = weather_data['weather'][0]['description']

    # Simple rules for suggesting actions based on weather conditions
    if 'rain' in weather_description:
        return "It's raining. Consider delaying outdoor activities or implementing drainage solutions."
    elif 'snow' in weather_description:
        return "It's snowing. Ensure proper protection for crops and livestock."
    elif temperature > 30:
        return "High temperature detected. Increase watering frequency for crops and provide shade for livestock."
    elif temperature < 5:
        return "Low temperature detected. Protect crops from frost and ensure proper heating for livestock."
    else:
        return "Weather conditions are favorable. No specific actions needed."

    # Main code block
if __name__ == "__main__":
    api_key = "YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY"  # Replace with your API key
    city = "YOUR_CITY_NAME"  # Replace with your city name
    
    # Fetch weather data
    weather_data = get_weather(api_key, city)
    print("Weather data:", weather_data)
    
    # Suggest actions based on weather conditions
    suggested_actions = suggest_actions(weather_data)
    print("Suggested actions:", suggested_actions)
```


In conclusion, the weather analysis project developed with PyCharm provides valuable insights into agricultural decision-making through AI-driven weather analysis, with special thanks to ChatGPT for its assistance in crafting effective code solutions and providing insightful guidance throughout the project's development journey
